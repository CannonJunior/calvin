# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Context
This is a Stock Market Earnings Analysis Dashboard project that integrates:
- D3.js visualizations for earnings timeline
- MCP server integrations for financial analysis
- Ollama chat interface for AI-powered queries
- Portfolio management capabilities
- Real-time market data display

The main dashboard is implemented in `earnings_dashboard.html` with comprehensive features for financial analysis and portfolio tracking.

## Important Instruction Reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

## Deprecated Directory Restrictions
NEVER use anything from the `deprecated/` directory unless specifically asked by the user.
You are NOT allowed to read from `deprecated/` unless you ask the user for permission every time.
Always verify with the user before accessing any files in `deprecated/`.
